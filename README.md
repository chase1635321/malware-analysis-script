# Malware Analysis Script
A radare2 script that speeds up malware analysis

## High level
- On start, asks for project name and creates project to save
- Displays information about stripping, bits, architecture, compiler, etc
- Generates basic report template
- Call function naming assistor
- Call manual analysis assistor
- Call static program simulator

---

## Function renamer
- Append API call info like (WriteFile(), etc)
- Prepends leaf functions with `l`
- Prepends complex functions with `c`
- Prepends top level global callgraph functions with `t`

## Function naming assistor
- Gets a json of global call graph with `agCj`
- Does custom DFS/BFS combo on global call graph
- For each function `pdfs`, give function a new name

## Manual analysis assistor
- Gets a json of global call graph with `agCj`
- Filters away unimportant functions
- Goes through each function, asks for single sentence describing functionality
- Generates an report image/list that contains a call graph layout of this functionality

## Static program simulator
- Does DFS on global call graph to simulate run
- Branching is user directed

## Report generation
- Creates a report.md file that will contain the report information
- Generates a table that contains information about strip, bits, architecture, etc
- Generates a table that has important import/export information
- Generate a table for interesting strings
- Adds an image of global call graph, generated with `agCw` command
- Adds section for important functions
- Adds section for minor functions

## Other Ideas
- Include code coverage information
- Generates a function call graph
